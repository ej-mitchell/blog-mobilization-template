# Mobilization Template

## About

* Based on https://github.com/NikitaZanella/11ty-SASS
* Intended to be a simple blogging/information sharing template to encourage the mobilization of folx for radical change.
* Differences from original package: improved theming, connection to Netlify
    CMS, ability to edit inside Netlify CMS.

## Includes
* SASS file with light/dark mode (thanks to NikitaZanella)
* Color variables
* A blog and project sections that can be edited in Netlify CMS. (Titles of
    these can change according to your needs or removed outright.)
* A front page and about page that supports markdown.

## How to use
* Review the code here. Feel free to change the color variables in the associated
    SASS file or any of the features mentioned above.
* Deploy the template to your Netlify account.
* Set up your Identify tab in Netlify to allow users (including yourself) to
    sign in and create content on the CMS.
* LET'S GO! Create some sweet, sweet content.

## Notes
* I suggest creating users and allowing invite-only folx to contribute material.
* Projects is a secondary tab for similar text support as Blog. If you want it
    to be named something else, you can change it in the `.eleventy.js` file and
    the associated `yml` config. It is easily removed too, if you just want a
    blog.

## Room for improvement
* I am working on better support for editing the Home and About pages directly
    in the CMS. Feel free to open a PR on this template to contribute, though.
    I'm very busy and could use help.
* Better naming for things and media support (e.g., ability to add photos). I
    *think* the latter should work but I haven't tested it and want to do that
    before saying it is available.
